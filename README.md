# Overview

Welcome to the Wine Quality Classification project! This project focuses on using machine learning to predict and assess the quality of wines based on their chemical attributes. The goal is to provide valuable insights for wine producers and enthusiasts, aiding in the assessment and selection of high-quality wines.

# Potential Use

- **Wine Producers**: Wine producers can use the developed classification model to assess and improve the quality of their wines by analyzing chemical attributes.
- **Wine Enthusiasts**: Wine enthusiasts can benefit from this project by gaining a deeper understanding of the factors influencing wine quality.
- **Retailers**: Retailers can make data-driven decisions on wine selections and inventory management.
- **Restaurants**: Restaurants can enhance their wine offerings and pair wines with dishes more effectively.

# Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: To get started, clone the project repository to your local machine:

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by following the instructions in the project's README file.

3. **Explore the Notebooks**: Review the Jupyter notebooks in the "notebooks" directory for data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

4. **Run the Scripts**: Execute the Python scripts in the "scripts" directory to train and deploy the classification model.

5. **Utilize the Model**: Make use of the trained model for wine quality classification in your own projects or applications.

This project aims to simplify the process of wine quality assessment and enhance the overall wine experience for all stakeholders.
